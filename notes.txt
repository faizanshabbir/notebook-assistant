 validate notebook format?
 assume notebook format is correct?

 write function that takes "upload" file and gets contents?

 wherever we call claude or openai, we should be logging our users too so we can see who is using most.

 Should we include a big textbox so people can paste their content there too? idk

Notebook checks?
- Check if notebook valid?
- Check notebook extensions?

 Playground for end to end testing:
 - Create databricks account?
 - Install jupyterlab?

 Research? 
 - Scrape python noteboos online?
 - Read about vercel functions? https://vercel.com/docs/functions
